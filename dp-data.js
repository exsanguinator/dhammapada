    // Pairs
    
    1:	'All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with an evil mind, suffering (dukkha) follows him just as the wheel follows the hoof-print of the ox that draws the cart.',
    
    2:	'All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness (sukha) follows him like a shadow that never leaves him.',
    
    3:	'"He abused me, he ill-treated me, he got the better of me, he stole my belongings;"... the enmity of those harbouring such thoughts cannot be appeased.',
    
    4:	'"He abused me, he ill-treated me, he got the better of me, he stole my belongings;"... the enmity of those not harbouring such thoughts can be appeased.',
    
    5:	'Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world. It is appeased only by loving-kindness. This is an ancient Law.',
    
    6:	'People, other than the wise, do not realize, "We in this world must all die," and not realizing it continue their quarrels. The wise realize it and thereby their quarrels cease.',
    
    7:	'He who keeps his mind on pleasant objects, who is uncontrolled in his senses, immoderate in his food, and is lazy and lacking in energy, will certainly be overwhelmed by defilements (Mara), just as stormy winds uproot a weak tree.',
    
    8:	'He who keeps his mind on the impurities of the body, who is well-controlled in his senses, and is full of faith and energy, will certainly be not overwhelmed by Mara, just as stormy winds cannot shake a mountain of rock.',
    
    9:	'He who is not free from taints of moral defilements (kilesas) and yet dons the yellow robe, who lacks restraint and speaks not the truth, is unworthy of the yellow robe.',
    
    10:	'He who has discarded all moral defilements (kilesas), who is established in moral precepts, is endowed with restraint and speaks the truth, is indeed worthy of the yellow robe.',
    
    11:	'They take untruth for truth; they take truth for untruth; such persons can never arrive at the truth, for they hold wrong views.',
    
    12:	'They take truth for truth; they take untruth for untruth; such persons arrive at the truth, for they hold right views.',
    
    13:	'Just as rain penetrates a badly-roofed house, so also, passion (raga) penetrates a mind not cultivated in Tranquillity and Insight Development (Samatha and Vipassana).',
    
    14:	'Just as rain cannot penetrate a well-roofed house, so also, passion (raga) cannot penetrate a mind well-cultivated in Tranquillity and Insight Development (Samatha and Vipassana).',
    
    15:	'Here he grieves, hereafter he grieves; the evil-doer grieves in both existences. He grieves and he suffers anguish when he sees the depravity of his own deeds.',
    
    16:	'Here he rejoices, hereafter he rejoices; one who performs meritorious deeds rejoices in both existences. He rejoices and greatly rejoices when he sees the purity of his own deeds.',
    
    17:	'Here he is tormented, hereafter he is tormented; the evil-doer is tormented in both existences. He is tormented, and he laments: "Evil have I done," He is even more tormented when he is reborn in one of the lower worlds (apaya).',
    
    18:	'Here he is happy, hereafter he is happy; one who performs meritorious deeds is happy in both existences. Happily he exclaims: "I have done meritorious deeds." He is happier still when he is reborn in a higher world (suggati).',
    
    19:	'Though he recites much the Sacred Texts (Tipitaka), but is negligent and does not practise according to the Dhamma, like a cowherd who counts the cattle of others, he has no share in the benefits of the life of a bhikkhu (i.e., Magga-phala).',
    
    20:	'Though he recites only a little of the Sacred Texts (Tipitaka), but practises according to the Dhamma, eradicating passion, ill will and ignorance, clearly comprehending the Dhamma, his mind freed from moral defilements and no longer clinging to this world or to the next, he shares the benefits of the life of a bhikkhu (i.e., Magga-phala).',
    
    // Heedfulness
    
    21:	'Mindfulness is the way to the Deathless (Nibbana), unmindfulness is the way to Death. Those who are mindful do not die; those who are not mindful are as if already dead.',
    
    22: 'Fully comprehending this, the wise who are mindful, rejoice in being mindful and find delight in the domain of the Noble Ones (ariyas).',
    
    23:	'The wise, constantly cultivating Tranquillity and Insight Development Practice, being ever mindful and steadfastly striving realize Nibbana: Nibbana, which is free from the bonds of yoga; Nibbana, the Incomparable!',
    
    24:	'If a person is energetic, mindful, pure in his thought, word and deed, and if he does everything with care and consideration, restrains his senses, earns his living according to the Law (Dhamma), and, is not unheedful, then, the fame and fortune of the mindful person steadily increase.',
    
    25:	'Through diligence, mindfulness, discipline with regard to moral precepts and control of his senses, let the man of wisdom make of himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.',
    
    26:	'The foolish and the ignorant give themselves over to negligence; whereas the wise treasure mindfulness as a precious jewel.',
    
    27:	'One should not be negligent, nor be addicted to sensual pleasures; for he who is established in mindfulness, through cultivation of Tranquillity and Insight Development Practice, experiences supreme happiness (i.e., realizes Nibbana).',
    
    28:	'The wise one dispels negligence by means of mindfulness; he ascends the tower of wisdom and being free from sorrow looks at the sorrowing beings. Just as one on the mountain top looks at those on the plain below, so also the wise one (the arahat) looks at the foolish and the ignorant worldlings.',
    
    29:	'Mindful amongst the negligent, highly vigilant amongst the drowsy, the man of wisdom advances like a race-horse, leaving the jade behind.',
    
    30:	'Through mindfulness in doing meritorious deeds Magha became king of the devas. Mindfulness is always praised, but negligence is always blamed.',
    
    31:	'A bhikkhu who takes delight in mindfulness and sees danger in negligence advances like fire, burning up all fetters. Great and small.',
    
    32:	'A bhikkhu who takes delight in mindfulness and sees danger in negligence cannot fall away; he is, indeed, very close to Nibbana.',
    
    // The Mind

    33:	'The mind is excitable and unsteady; it is difficult to control and to restrain. The wise one trains his mind to be upright as a fletcher straightens an arrow.',
    
    34:	'As a fish quivers when taken out of its watery home and thrown on to dry ground, so does the mind quiver when it is taken out of the sensual world to escape from the realm of Mara (i.e., kilesa vatta, round of moral defilements).',
    
    35:	'The mind is difficult to control; swiftly and lightly it moves and lands wherever it pleases. It is good to tame the mind, for a well-tamed mind brings happiness.',
    
    36:	'The mind is difficult to see, very delicate and subtle; it moves and lands wherever it pleases. The wise one should guard his mind, for a guarded mind brings happiness.',
    
    37:	'The mind wanders far and moves about alone; it is non-material; it lies in the cave (chamber of the heart). Those who control their mind will be free from the bonds of defilement (Mara).',
    
    38:	'If a man\'s mind is unsteady, if he is ignorant of the true Dhamma, and if his faith is wavering, then his knowledge will never be perfect.',
    
    39:	'If a man\'s mind is free from passion, if he is free from ill will, if he has abandoned both good and evil, and if he is vigilant, for such a man there is no danger.',
    
    40:	'Knowing that this body is fragile like an earthen jar, making one\'s mind secure like a fortified town, one should fight ignorance (Mara) with the weapon of knowledge. After defeating Mara one should still continue to guard one\'s mind, and feel no attachment to that which has been gained (i.e., jhana ecstasy and serenity gained through meditation).',
    
    41:	'Before long, alas! this body, deprived of consciousness, will lie on the earth, discarded like a useless log.',
    
    42:	'A thief may harm a thief; an enemy may harm an enemy; but a wrongly directed mind can do oneself far greater harm.',
    
    43:	'Not a mother, nor a father, nor any other relative can do more for the well-being of one than a rightly-directed mind can.',
    
    // Flowers
    
    44:	'Who shall examine this body, the world of Yama (i.e., the four states) and the world of man together with the world of devas? Who shall examine the well-taught Path of Virtue (Dhammapada) as an expert florist picks and chooses flowers?',
    
    45:	'The striver-on-the path shall examine this body, the world of Yama (i.e. the four states) and the world of man together with the world of devas. The striver shall examine the well-taught Path of Virtue (Dhammapada) as an expert florist picks and chooses flowers?',
    
    46:	'One who knows that this body is impermanent like froth, and comprehends that it is insubstantial as a mirage, will cut the flowers of Mara (i.e., the three kinds of rounds), and pass out of sight of the King of Death.',
    
    47:	'Like one who picks and chooses flowers, a man who has his mind attached to sensual pleasures is carried away by Death, just as a great flood sweeps away a sleeping village.',
    
    48:	'Like one who picks and chooses flowers, a man who has his mind attached to sensual pleasures and is insatiate in them is overpowered by Death.',
    
    49:	'As the bee collects nectar and flies away without damaging the flower or its colour or its scent, so also, let the bhikkhu dwell and act in the village without affecting the faith and generosity or the wealth of the villagers.',
    
    50:	'One should not consider the faults of others, nor their doing or not doing good or bad deeds. One should only consider whether one has done or not done good or bad deeds.',
    
    51:	'Just as a beautiful flower, lacking in scent, cannot give the wearer the benefit of its scent, so also, the well-preached words of the Buddha cannot benefit one who does not practise the Dhamma.',
    
    52:	'Just as a flower, beautiful as well as fragrant, will give the wearer the benefit of its scent, so also, the well-preached words of the Buddha will benefit one who practises the Dhamma.',
    
    53:	'As from a collection of flowers many a garland can be made by an expert florist, so also, much good can be done with wealth, out of faith and generosity, by one subject to birth and death.',
    
    54:	'The scent of flowers cannot go against the wind; nor the scent of sandalwood, nor of rhododendron, nor of jasmin; only the reputation of good people can go against the wind. The reputation of the virtuous ones is wafted abroad in all directions.',
    
    55:	'There are the scents of sandalwood, rhododendron, lotus and jasmin; but the scent of virtue surpasses all scents.',
    
    56:	'The scents of rhododendron and of sandalwood are very faint, but the scent (reputation) of the virtuous is the strongest; it spreads even to the abodes of the devas.',
    
    57:	'Delusion (Mara) cannot find the path taken by those who are endowed with virtue, who live mindfully, and have been freed from moral defilements by Right Knowledge.',
    
    58: 'As a sweet smelling and beautiful lotus flower may grow upon a heap of rubbish thrown on the highway, so also, out of the rubbish heap of beings may appear a disciple of the Buddha, who with his wisdom shines forth far above the ignorant worldlings.',
    
    59: 'As a sweet smelling and beautiful lotus flower may grow upon a heap of rubbish thrown on the highway, so also, out of the rubbish heap of beings may appear a disciple of the Buddha, who with his wisdom shines forth far above the ignorant worldlings.',
    
    // The Fool
    
    60: 'Long is the night to one who is wakeful; long is the journey of one league to the traveller who is tired; long is samsara (round of rebirths) to the fool who is ignorant of the true Dhamma (the Teaching of the Buddha).',
    
    61: 'If a person seeking a companion cannot find one who is better than or equal to him, let him resolutely go on alone; there can be no companionship with a fool.',
    
    62:  '"I have sons, I have wealth"; with this feeling of attachment the fool is afflicted. Indeed, he himself is not his own, how can sons and wealth be his?',
    
    63: 'The fool who knows that he is a fool can for that reason be a wise man; but the fool who thinks that he is wise is, indeed, called a fool.',
    
    64: 'A fool, even though he is associated with a wise man all his life, does not understand the Dhamma, just as a ladle does not know the taste of soup.',
    
    65: 'An intelligent man, even though he is associated with a wise man only for a moment, quickly understands the Dhamma, just as the tongue knows the taste of soup.',
    
    66: 'With themselves as their own enemies, fools lacking in intelligence move about doing evil deeds, which bear bitter fruits.',
    
    67: 'That deed is not well done if one has to repent for having done it, and if with a tearful face, one has to weep as a result of that deed.',
    
    68: 'That deed is well done if one has not to repent for having done it, and if one is delighted and happy with the result of that deed.',
    
    69: 'As long as the evil deed does not bear fruit, the fool thinks it is sweet like honey; but when his evil deed does bear fruit, the fool suffers for it.',
    
    70: 'Even though, month after month, the fool living in austerity takes his food sparingly with the tip of a grass blade, he is not worth even one-sixteenth part of those who have comprehended the Truth.',
    
    71: 'An evil deed does not immediately bear fruit, just as the newly-drawn milk does not curdle at once; but it follows the fool, burning him like live coal covered with ashes.',
    
    72: 'The skill of a fool can only harm him; it destroys his merit and his wisdom.',
    
    73: 'The foolish bhikkhu desires praise for qualities he does not have, precedence among bhikkhus, authority in the monasteries, and veneration from those unrelated to him.',
    
    74: '"Let both laymen and bhikkhus think that things are done because of me; let them obey me in all matters, great and small." Such being the thoughts of the fool, his greed and his pride grow.',
    
    75: 'Indeed, the path that leads to worldly gain is one, and the Path that leads to Nibbana is another. Fully comprehending this, the bhikkhu, the disciple of the Buddha, should not take delight in worldly gain and honour, but devote himself to solitude, detachment and the realization of Nibbana.',
